1. write a java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. first thread generates random integer every 1 second and if the value is even, 
   second thread computes the square of the number and prints. if the value is odd, the third thread will print the value of cube of the number.
2. Devise a Java program with three thread synchronization(thread-1 to generate prime numbers,thread-2 to generate 11 multiplication table andthread-3 to print the sequence 
   3,6,18,72â€¦..)Use both synchronized/joint() methods2.
